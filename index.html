        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a mechanical engineer with a strong focus on designing manufacturable, high-volume products. I specialize in mechanical systems, PCB design, and embedded firmware, bringing concepts from early design through to real-world deployment. My work has been primarily in the security industry, with products in the field worldwide.</p>

	       <h3>Intelligent Drive Unit for Locking System</h3>
        <img src="1.jpg" alt="Intelligent Drive Unit">
 
        <p>
            I designed the PCB and firmware for an advanced locking system.  
            It used various sensors, including Hall effect sensors and detector switches,  
            to control a geared motor, ensuring precise locking position control and secure status feedback.  
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            The unit provided logic-level feedback and a photo relay output,  
            making it compatible with third-party systems.  
            It could receive commands via high/low signals or serial communication.  
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            While the PCB was housed in a larger enclosure,  
            my focus was on electronics and firmware.  
            I also developed a system for in-field reprogramming using one-wire UPDI  
            and a USB-C flashing tool, allowing users to update firmware easily.  
        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
            This system has been deployed in industries like vending machines  
            and DNA sampling kiosks, proving its adaptability and reliability.

 <h3>Patented Motorised Rotary Latch</h3>
    <img src="3.jpg" alt="Patented Motorised Rotary Latch">
  
    <p>
        I played a key role in this project, leading the mechanical design, prototyping, testing,<br> 
        DFM, and full-scale production of all components.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This included plastic injection moulded parts, sheet metal, die-cast, and turned components,<br> 
        ensuring a highly durable and manufacturable solution.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Alongside the mechanical work, I also designed the PCB and firmware,<br> 
        ensuring seamless integration with the system.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        With custom firmware, auto-relock, and soft closure features,<br> 
        this latch sets a new standard for secure, durable, and adaptable locking solutions.

<h3>Wireless & BLE Control Node</h3>
    <img src="2.jpg" alt="Wireless & BLE Control Node">  
    <p>
        This wireless and BLE-enabled control node provides secure, remote access control<br> 
        without the need for hardwiring. It can operate as a standalone controller<br> 
        or as part of a mesh system, relaying control and feedback messages securely.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Designed for low-power operation, it can run on an internal battery<br> 
        and supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and encrypted communication.

    <h3>USB & Network Control Demonstration Tool</h3>
    <img src="5.jpg" alt="USB & Network Control Demonstration Tool">
    
    <p>
        I developed a standalone desktop application to provide a user-friendly interface<br> 
        for demonstrating and testing a USB and network-controlled device.<br> 
        Previously, demonstrations were done manually through serial commands in Tera Term,<br> 
        which was inefficient and difficult for non-technical users.<br>  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This tool was designed to streamline the process, making it easy for customers testing samples<br> 
        and sales teams showcasing the product.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Key Features</h4>
    <p>
        - <b>Graphical Interface:</b> Built using Tkinter and CustomTkinter for a clean, dark-themed UI.<br> 
        - <b>Serial Communication:</b> Automatically detects and connects to the correct USB device.<br> 
        - <b>Real-Time Logging:</b> Displays sent commands and received responses in a live feed.<br> 
        - <b>Toggle Controls:</b> Provides easy ON/OFF buttons for controlling device outputs.<br> 
        - <b>Dropdown Commands:</b> Allows quick selection of functions like lock/unlock, relock settings,<br> 
          temperature monitoring, and relay control.<br> 
        - <b>Multi-Device Support:</b> Can communicate with multiple locks over a network or USB,<br> 
          enabling bulk control of devices.<br> 
        - <b>Scalability:</b> Designed for future expansion, allowing additional devices and features<br> 
          to be added without requiring major rewrites.<br> 
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Development & Deployment</h4>
    <p>
        - Fully compiled as an EXE for easy distribution to customers and sales teams.<br> 
        - Trained internal teams to use the tool effectively.<br> 
        - Significantly reduced onboarding time for customers testing the product.<br> 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This application transformed the way the product was demonstrated,<br> 
        making it more professional, efficient, and accessible.
